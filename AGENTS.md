# Database Environment Guidelines
- **Local Development**: Uses PostgreSQL 15 in Docker container with connection string `postgresql://vibe_user:vibe_pass@postgres:5432/vibe_scraper`
- **Database Inspection**: Always inspect the PostgreSQL database in Docker - never use local SQLite
- **Migration Verification**: Run `python manage.py migrate` in Docker to ensure schema matches models
- **Table Naming**: Django creates tables as `appname_modelname` (e.g., `Location` model â†’ `core_location` table)
