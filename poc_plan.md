# POC Plan

## Goals
- Validate core scraping and processing.
- Integrate n8n with Apify.
- Add geocoding and basic processing.
- Test end-to-end flow.

## Steps
1. Set up n8n locally (docker-compose).
2. Integrate Apify in n8n workflows.
3. Build scraping workflow (Instagram).
4. Add geocoding (geopy).
5. Test end-to-end: Scrape → Process → Store.
